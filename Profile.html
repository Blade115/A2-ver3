<p>Looking at my results from the data, I am a visual learner and if you look at both the Myers<br>-Briggs Test and Big Five Personality Test it is easy to see a definite similarity in the <br>areas of introversion, Neuroticism, and Agreeableness/Feeling. I think it is plausible to <br>assume that the data points that are consistent between the two different personality <br>tests are most likely true whereas the outliers; judging/conscientiousness, imagination, <br>and intuition can mostly be ignored or taken with a grain of salt. <br><br><br>
 
I am an “Advocate” according to the Myers-Briggs test. This would seem to line up with the <br>Big Five test as well as with my personal experience. I am a fairly recluse person, filled<br> with a lot of self-doubt, and always end up helping everyone else but myself. I <br>don’t make friends easily and don’t have many of them. But I like to believe that the <br>friends I do have are trustworthy and can be relied on. I find it normal to help people <br>around me. It is more than the right thing to do for me. It is the natural thing to do. I <br>feel in my element when helping others. I generally have a hard time with creativity, <br>art, and imagination. But when I am helping others with their creative endeavours I <br>suddenly burst with ideas. There is a quiet cynicism to me though. As I push everyone <br>up, it seems that I only fall down. It’s not just that I like helping people, it’s that I can <br>only help people and nothing else. <br><br><br>
 
In a team, I might find it hard to initiate the conversation or lead the group if that is <br>necessary as I am generally introverted. I would not deal with team drama or hyper-<br>competitiveness very well as I am very agreeable and work better in a supportive <br>environment where team members regularly assist one another. I can let criticism get <br>to me and give up too easily. I tend to have high sudden bursts of energy where I study <br>attentively and enthusiastically but also sharp lows where I ignore work because I am <br>not in the right mood. Since I tend to help others more, I find that I have a difficult time <br>asking for help and focusing on my own work. <br><br><br>
 
In a team, I should aim to start up discussions regularly and organise meetings more. I <br>should keep in contact with my colleagues and strive to put that helping nature to <br>good use. I should take and give criticism fairly and treat it as a group learning <br>experience to better the project. I should not let my assistance of other group <br>members over-shadow my responsibilities and work. I should take assistance when <br>needed and not just help others to my deterrent. I should take more advantage of my <br>sudden bursts of energy to get more work done while also making sure to keep a <br>steady flow of work going and not lose motivation.
