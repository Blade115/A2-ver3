<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<img src="ai profile 5.jpg" alt="Job Advert">
<p>My ideal job in IT is structured and formulaic. Where if I know what to do and how to do it, I <br>just need to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to complete my task and <br>then go home. A job as a software tester intrigues me for that reason. I would clock in, <br>gather data, set up tests, and troubleshoot until the sun comes down just to do it the <br>next day. In this IT job, the main tasks are to oversee new software, test it, and make <br>sure it works. I would gather and analyze data, create test plans, construct both <br>manual and automatic tests (for UI, logs, and databases), assist others, give tips on how <br>to troubleshoot their work, and of course troubleshoot as well. 
<br><br><br>This job interests me as I am looking for a more passive role in IT as someone who sits at the <br>back helping others while still being part of a team effort. One of this job’s roles is to <br>be both comfortable in group tasks and solo work. I think I would be exemplary in this <br>environment as I would be able to help others in a group while still having my own <br>space to work alone. Another skill requirement is a critical and detailed mindset. I tend <br>to take things slow and methodical making sure everything is right to a tee. This can <br>sometimes be a detriment. However, I think in this work environment it would be a <br>great strength. <br><br><br>
The job requires a qualification in computer science or a degree in a relevant field. A <br>qualification that can only come with time and a lot of effort. I’ll also need two or more <br>years of experience in Linux and Windows UI testing. They also ask for relevant <br>experience in JIRA (a proprietary issue tracking), GIT (a software system that tracks <br>changes in any set of files allowing programmers to collaboratively work on projects), <br>and SVN (an open-source version control system). Finally, familiarity in languages such <br>as Python, Bash, and MySQL is essential. <br><br><br>
If I want to have this job in the future, I will need to work hard to understand a variety of <br>programming languages and become acquainted with the many programs in the IT <br>world such as GIT and JIRA. Also, I will need relevant work experience and a degree in <br>computer science or a related field. All things come in time, but you have to start <br>somewhere so hopefully this introductory course into IT will lead me down <br> a long and fulfilling path to new knowledge and future possibilities.
