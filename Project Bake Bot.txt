<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>People new to baking can get quite surprised with all the mathematics and measuring <br>involved. Fractions, multiplication, division, addition. The prep work behind the recipes <br>can become quite complicated. If only there was some kind of robot to do all the math <br>for you. Like a Bake Bot. That would calculate and measure your recipes for you, and <br>make sure you’re organised, on track, and aren’t making any mistakes. So, you can have <br>your perfectly baked dish hassle-free. No multiplication, no addition, no fuss. When it <br>comes to cooking, Bake Bot says Muffins, not math.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>For a lot of people, baking can look intimidating, with precise measurements, complex <br>recipes, and mistakes that lead to disaster. Many may be interested in baking but are <br>driven away by the fear that it is too hard and complicated. So, if there was an <br>application or program that could automatically calculate the exact amounts and <br>measurements for you. You would just have to punch in the numbers, and it would <br>eliminate that fear. However, new bakers wouldn’t be the only ones to benefit from an <br>app like this. For experienced bakers, this would allow ease and convenience. Like when <br>you want to make more or less than the recommended amount, or if a recipe keeps on <br>switching between grams, tbsps, and cups. It can get confusing and time-consuming. <br How many grams are there in a tbsps.? Or millilitres in a cup? I don’t know and you probably <br>need to look it up. But with Bake Bot you won’t need to.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>There are six main operations Bake Bot will perform.</p>

<h5>First operation</h5>
<p>With Bake Bot, the user will be able to pick a recipe and choose what quantity of that given <br>recipe they want to make. <br><br>
As an example, if you decided to make a batch of muffins, but you wanted to make just a <br>little bit more than twelve. The solution seems simple double the ingredients, but <br>twenty-four muffins is a lot. No, you want fifteen muffins, just enough for the office or <br>a kids soccer team. But the problem is, you can’t just multiple by two now. Fifteen is an <br>odd number to multiple by. Particularly from twelve. How much more ingredients <br>would you need? You would have to first divide and find out how much one muffin is <br>from a batch of twelve and then multiple by fifteen, and this all just seems too <br>bothersome. Especially when you just want to bake. With Bake Bot, all you do is type in <br>that you want fifteen muffins and it does all the mathematics for you, so you can focus <br>on baking some muffins. 
</p>

<h5>Sceond operation</h5>
<p>Bake Bot will have a dynamic recipe. That will change depending on how much you want to <br>make. With accurate ingredient amounts, baking times, and step-by-step procedures <br>depending on your choice. This dynamic recipe will also be a godsend for any baker <br>with amounts in all measurement types. Each ingredient will have its amount in grams, <br>tbsps, tsps, cups, litres, millilitres, and gallons and ounces too if you’re American. Never <br>again will you have to quickly lookup how many grams there are in a cup or millilitres in <br>a tbsps. It will be right here in the dynamic recipe. </p>

<h5>Third operation</h5>
<p>Bake Bot will have a step-by-step baking guide from start to finish. It will give you the exact <br>time you need to bake a given dish with a countdown alarm, so you never burn your <br>bread. It will also show you the precise temperature you need for either fan-forced or <br>conventional ovens and when you have to change temperatures to get that tasty crust <br>or temporarily take out your cake for those multi-staged recipes. Bake Bot will have you <br>covered. Is it your first time baking a new recipe? No problem. Bake Bot will give you <br>handy tips and tricks so your first time making a souffle isn’t a learning experience<br> but a delicious one.</p>

<h5>Fourth operation</h5>
<p>Ever wanted to bake a specific recipe but forgot its name and can’t for the life of you find it <br>anywhere? Or maybe you want to try something new that you have never had before? <br>With Bake Bot’s intuitive tag-based search function you can. Just enter in some key <br>details like; sweet or savoury; French, British, or Danish dishes; is it a dessert, tea cake, <br>or breakfast meal? You will find what you want in a flash. And if you just want to try <br>new things you can randomly search for recipes by difficulty, you’ll always know<br> what you’re getting into.    </p>

<h5>Fifth operation</h5>
<p>Bake Bot doesn’t just help you bake, it teachers you to. Completely new to baking and <br>cooking in general? Don’t worry. Bake Bot’s baking course is a structured short course <br>to teach you the fundamentals of baking from beginner to expert. You will start will <br>beginner-friendly dishes and work your way up. Informative notes in each recipe will <br>help you at every step of the way to master each recipe. And don’t worry. You won’t be <br>thrown into the fire. These recipes are so simple you could use Bake Bot’s Baking <br>course to teach your child to bake.</p>

<h5>Sixth operation</h5>
<p>Bake Bot also has a nifty little feature where you can save and keep your favourite <br>personalised dynamic recipes in the Baking Journal. So that they’re never lost, and you <br>don’t have to go through the hassle of picking a particular quantity every time you start <br>the same recipe again. You can also use the Baking Journal to see your history of bakes, <br>so you can make them again or pick out your favourites. With Bake Bot, an entire <br>baking book and more is at your fingertips and always by your side.</p>

<h5>Tools and Technologies</h5>
<p>I will most likely use MIT App Inventor to make my project as I am still very new to <br>programming and don’t have a lot of experience, rather than going into the deep end <br>and coding it from scratch in basic Java for Android phones. I can use the App Inventor <br>to greatly streamline and speed up the development of the app as MIT App Inventor is <br>incredibly intuitive with the use of a graphical user interface (GUI). MIT App Inventor <br>uses YAIL code on top of Java that interprets the code to be used, so you never see the <br>source code. Besides ease of use, another reason I want to use MIT App Inventor is that <br>I want Baking Bot to be a phone app. As phone apps are generally more popular, <br>intuitive, and convenient. It will allow people to always have it near to help when <br>baking, rather than having to lug a computer around.</p>

<h5>Skills Required</h5>
<p>Since the project is simple but provides great utility, the skills required are fairly low. Most<br> of the work will be code and some user interface. With the majority of the code <br>being simple integer calculations and if, then, else, statements. The user interface could <br>provide some difficulty as I have little experience in creating interfaces and phone apps <br>in general. And as always coding is never fast or easy no matter how straightforward it <br>seems, so there are bound to be many errors and bugs that will need to be ironed out <br>and operations streamlined. </p>

<h5>Outcome</h5>
<p>If this project is successful, I think it will make the process of baking significantly easier for <br>new bakers, bakers looking to streamline their craft, or people that just want a hassle-free<br> time when they decide to bake every now and then. Some people might be <br>intimidated by baking and don’t want to mess it up, particularly if it’s their first time or <br>they’re making it for family, friends, or a loved one and want to impress them. One<br> small mistake when measuring, in some baking recipes, can mean a big disappointment <br>when it comes out of the oven. So, if my project is successful. This predicament will <br>permanently be solved.</p>
