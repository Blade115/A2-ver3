<p>Hi, my name is Blade Sabre. I am a student at RMIT University. My student number is <br>3904117 and my student Email is s3904117@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in <br>Australia. In Queensland. I am Irish-Scottish on my father’s side and Japanese, <br> immigrant on my mother’s. So, I got to experience two completely different cultures <br>growing up. My parents moved to Victoria when I was little. So, I only really remember <br>living in Victoria as a child. My parents were early adopters of computers and all things <br>tech, so as I child I have always been close to it. I have a long and extensive history with<br> online education as I live in the countryside away from most schools and bustling <br>cities. I am very into world history and events. And like to study different cultures <br>around the world. Mostly Asian and European. I also have two pet cats: a mother, and a <br>daughter. Both are strays that I found in the front yard of my house. Starving and in need of <br>food and shelter. They are now incredibly happy and health and fit right in as a part of the family. </p>
